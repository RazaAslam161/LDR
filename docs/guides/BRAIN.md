# BRAIN.md — session handoff

Working state for **Miles** (Flutter + Supabase couples app). Read this instead
of the chat history. Last updated 2026-08-14.

## 0. The thing to get right

**Raza gives a complaint, not a spec.** He has corrected this four times in one
session. The failure mode, verbatim from the memory file:

> If my change list contains one file and his complaint contains one screen, I
> have almost certainly done it again.

Before touching anything: grep for **every** call site, every widget that renders
that kind of thing, every entry point. Fixing one and missing four is the thing
he keeps catching. See `~/.claude/projects/E--LDR/memory/expand-the-idea-dont-transcribe-it.md`.

**Second lesson, learned expensively this session:** four separate bugs were
*schema mismatches* — client code writing to columns that were never migrated.
None are catchable by `flutter test`; they compile perfectly and fail only
against the real database. **Query `information_schema` before believing a
client-side diagnosis.**

---

## 1. Where things are

- Repo `E:\LDR`, app in `mobile/`, branch **`fix-sprint`** (no remote, 260+ commits).
- Supabase prod **`sopictusdonlvuezmfep`** (staging `zqltaobarpcuantrqxha`).
- Test device: OnePlus 8 / **IN2015**, Android 13, arm64. adb at
  `C:/Users/razaa/AppData/Local/Android/Sdk/platform-tools/adb.exe`.
- Current build **16** (`pubspec.yaml` + `lib/core/app/release_gate.dart` must
  match). APK shipped as `E:\LDR\Miles.apk`, arm64 split, ~70–112 MB.
- **Debug-signed.** No `android/key.properties`. Release keystore steps were
  given; he hasn't made one. Debug SHA-1:
  `A1:05:79:47:08:8B:7A:21:4B:DA:C3:C2:BE:95:B3:03:95:74:64:C7`, package
  `com.miles.miles`.

---

## 2. Live on the server — already working, no rebuild needed

| Fix | Migration |
|---|---|
| `couple_intimate` accepts `application/octet-stream` (vault upload was 415) | `20260601006400` |
| `vault_items.storage_path` + `media_mime_type` added (was PGRST204) | `20260601006500` |
| `memory_threads` 4 delete columns (delete threw PGRST204) | `20260601006600` |
| `rituals` 6 columns incl. `deleted` — **the list query itself was failing** | `20260601006600` |
| `afterglow_entries` unique index on unsealed rows | `20260601006400` |
| `key_escrow` table | `20260601006700` |

Vault upload is **confirmed working** by the user.

---

## 3. In code, needs an APK to reach the phone

- **Maps back on Mapbox** (`world_map_screen.dart`, restored from `02350cb`).
  Token via `map-token` edge function ← `app_secrets.MAPBOX_PUBLIC_TOKEN`. Never
  in the APK.
- **Home no longer mounts a map.** `_MapDoor` panel in
  `partner_location_card.dart` — Home used to stream tiles centred on the
  partner on open, with no interaction.
- **Afterglow** `replaceMySide` — was a hard StateError lockout.
- **WebView disposed** in `world_map_screen` — its error card was compositing
  over the Afterglow screen.
- **Vault picker** → `PhotoPickerService` (was a bare `ImagePicker`, so it opened
  the file manager; also brings HEIC/ProRAW support).
- **Key escrow** (§5).
- **`CryptoCore.encryptBytesOffThread`** — 100 MB AES on the UI thread.

---

## 4. Open, with diagnosis

### 4a. Vault read path — THE next job
He asked for this and it is not done. Current design: thumbnails are encrypted
`bytea` **inside the `vault_items` row**, so every grid tile costs a decrypt.
That is why wheels appear on the grid, the pager and while scrolling.

Copy the chat pipeline, which is the working reference:
`core/media/media_decode.dart` (shared decode widths — **cache-key identity is
the whole trick**), `core/widgets/net_image.dart` (`thumb`, `decodeWidth`, never
`memCacheHeight`), `core/media/thumb_backfill.dart` (heal-on-read),
`features/chat/widgets/media_viewer.dart` (progressive thumb→full, neighbour
`precacheImage`, unconditional Hero).

`vault_media_cache.dart` already has isolate decrypt + dedup. Needs: thumbnails
as separate storage objects, decrypt-to-disk cached by item id, progressive
display, neighbour precache.

### 4b. Google Maps — dead, not fixable in code
Billing account **closed**, "not in good standing", cannot be reopened. Killed
both the 3D map and `google_maps_flutter`. Photorealistic 3D needs Google
billing; there is no free photogrammetry anywhere (Cesium resells Google's).
Mapbox is the ceiling without it. **Do not re-litigate this.**

### 4c. `google_fonts` leak
No bundled font assets → Fraunces + Inter fetched from `fonts.gstatic.com` on
first launch, before login, behind the disguise. Fix: bundle two `.ttf` files.
Needs him to supply them, or accept a system-font fallback.

### 4d. Unverified on hardware
Call **glare** (needs two phones dialling within a second) and **Watch Together**
sync (needs two phones on one video). Logic is unit-tested; the two-device
behaviour is not.

### 4e. Never verified at all
The Mapbox map has **never rendered on a device**. Not once, across the whole
session.

---

## 5. Key escrow — read before touching crypto

`FlutterSecureStorage` is wiped by Android on uninstall, so every reinstall used
to mint a new X25519 keypair, change the ECDH shared secret, and permanently
orphan every encrypted row. That is the `SecretBoxAuthenticationError` on memory
threads, fantasy jar and vault tiles. **The data was never corrupted; the key
was destroyed.**

`core/data/key_escrow.dart` seals the seed under `HKDF(password, salt)` +
XChaCha20-Poly1305 and stores it server-side. Server sees ciphertext only.

**`restore` runs BEFORE `backup` in `SupabaseRepository.signIn` — that ordering
is the entire fix.** Backing up first seals the throwaway key over the good one.

Not retroactive: rows under already-destroyed keys stay unreadable.
**Unverified — needs a real reinstall + sign-in to prove the round trip.**

---

## 6. Commands that matter

```bash
cd /e/LDR && flutter analyze mobile      # from ROOT — catches warnings the
                                         # in-mobile run misses, and the
                                         # hygiene test uses this
cd /e/LDR/mobile && flutter test         # 550 passing
cd /e/LDR/mobile && flutter build apk --release --split-per-abi
```

- Always `cd /e/LDR/mobile` before flutter build (CWD drifts).
- Build unprompted once green; **never install without an explicit request.**
- Repo hygiene tests enforce: 0 analyzer warnings, no translucent surfaces
  behind text (annotate genuine scrims `// scrim over <what>`), unique migration
  ordering keys, disguise intact.

**Logcat** (invaluable — it produced three root causes in one pass):
```bash
adb logcat -c
adb logcat -v time flutter:V chromium:W ActivityManager:I AndroidRuntime:E System.err:W *:E
```
Filter for `I/flutter` — the app's real errors are there, not on screen.

---

## 7. Standing constraints

- Never handle his API keys/tokens — give him the SQL, let him run it.
- Secrets go in `app_secrets` + an edge function, never the APK (pattern:
  `turn-credentials`, `map-token`).
- The launcher disguise ("News", 9 covers) is deliberate. Never revert it.
  There's a guard test; its `_tells` wordlist is easy to slip past.
- Plan for **thousands of users**, not the two test phones. No update channel —
  breaking changes need the server-side version gate.
- E2E encryption stays. If crypto is why something is slow, design around it.
- Verify every checkable claim **before** asserting it. Twice this session I
  reported a diagnosis that was stale or backwards (billing; the flutter_map
  disk cache) and had to correct myself to him.

## 8. NEXT JOB — Memory Threads, full redesign (asked 2026-08-14)

Not started. He asked for a redesign, not patches, and was explicit that
piecemeal fixing is the thing he keeps having to correct. **Design the whole
mechanism before writing anything.**

His requirements, verbatim intent:

1. **Attractive alignment / UI.** Current screen is cards with a date, a state
   chip and raw error text. He called it "ugly line up, not well maintained,
   not professionally designed."
2. **Silky smooth — opening, uploading, rendering, closing.** No buffering, no
   loading wheels, no quality drop.
3. **Genuinely shared between partners.**
4. **Delete with BOTH partners' permission** (dual consent). The columns now
   exist — `20260601006600` — but the UI never surfaced it.
5. **Gallery-style preview.**
6. **Multi-select upload, exactly like the chat album flow.**
7. **Expand it** — he wants invention, not just the literal list.

### What is already known about why it is broken

- Photos are encrypted `bytea` **inline in the row** (`photo_cipher`), so every
  card costs a decrypt. Same architectural mistake as the vault.
- `SecretBoxAuthenticationError` cards are rows encrypted under keys destroyed
  by earlier reinstalls (§5). Escrow stops it recurring; **those rows are
  permanently unreadable** and the UI must say so honestly instead of printing
  a crypto exception at the user.
- Delete columns exist and are unused by the UI.

### The reference implementations to copy

- **Media pipeline:** `core/media/media_decode.dart`, `core/widgets/net_image.dart`,
  `core/media/thumb_backfill.dart`, `features/chat/widgets/media_viewer.dart`.
  Cache-key identity is the whole trick — same key AND same decode width, and
  never `memCacheHeight`.
- **Multi-select upload + album grouping:** `features/chat/chat_send_queue.dart`
  (`albumId` when `items.length > 1`), `features/chat/widgets/album_bubble.dart`.
- **Gallery picker:** `core/services/photo_picker_service.dart` — never a bare
  `ImagePicker`, or it opens the file manager.
- **Dual consent already modelled:** `features/closer/private_vault` has
  request → confirm → hard delete with a 14-day escape hatch. Reuse the shape.

### Do not repeat

Thumbnails must be **separate storage objects**, not encrypted blobs in the
row. Generate before encryption, cache decrypted-to-disk keyed by item id.
That is the single decision that makes the difference between the chat pipeline
(fast) and the vault/threads (wheels everywhere).

## 9. State at end of session, 2026-08-14

**Build 21** at `E:\LDR\Miles.apk` (93 MB, arm64), sha256
`587b5e0d24dff9370af59798918c009525261aa8962ffd8a0376e75ba883523c`.
NOT installed — the phone was unplugged. Device on build 20.

**The redesign spec is written:** `docs/guides/memory-threads-spec.md`, 1264
lines. Its headline finding is not a UI problem — **a memory proposal fires no
notification at all.** `supabase/functions/` has care-notify, map-token,
reach-notify, turn-credentials and nothing for memories. Nine proposals across
two couples, zero acceptances, because the only way to find one is to open a
disguised app, pass the app lock, find the ninth tile in Closer, and enter a
PIN. Fix the notification before touching a pixel.

Fixed ahead of the redesign, both live:
- **Dual consent was a convention, not a rule.** `memory_threads_delete_member`
  allowed a plain DELETE by either partner — the whole request/confirm flow was
  bypassable with one PostgREST call. Policy dropped, grant revoked, rows now
  leave only via the state machine. Guard trigger makes `proposer` and
  `couple_id` immutable and rejects self-acceptance.
- **17 tables granted DELETE with no DELETE policy.** RLS denied them, but that
  is one layer. Revoked, catalogue-driven so it can be re-run.

Still open, in priority order:
1. Memory Threads redesign — spec is written, implementation not started.
2. Vault read path — same root cause (encrypted bytea inline in the row).
3. `google_fonts` fetches from Google on first launch.
4. Debug signing.

---

## 10. IMPLEMENTATION ORDER — read before touching either spec

Two specs exist:
- `docs/guides/memory-threads-spec.md` (1264 lines, complete)
- `docs/guides/vault-read-path-spec.md` (813 lines, complete)

**They have the same root cause and must not be implemented twice.** Both store
encrypted media as `bytea` INLINE in a database row, so every tile costs a
decrypt before it can paint. That single decision is why both features show
loading wheels everywhere while chat does not.

### Build the shared foundation FIRST

Neither feature works properly without it, and building it twice is how the two
drift apart:

1. **Encrypted thumbnail as a separate storage object.** Generated BEFORE
   encryption, encrypted with its own associated-data binding, uploaded as
   `application/octet-stream` to `couple_intimate`. Note: that bucket has
   SELECT/INSERT/DELETE storage policies but **no UPDATE policy**, so
   `upsert: true` returns 403 — either add the policy or never upsert.
2. **Decrypt-to-disk cache keyed by item id**, with an explicit security policy.
   This is plaintext on a device whose entire premise is that nothing is
   readable: decide when it is written, when wiped, and whether it survives the
   app lock, backgrounding, the disguise cover, sign-out and an adb backup.
   `vault_media_cache.dart` already has isolate decrypt + in-flight dedup and is
   the right place to grow this.
3. **Honest presentation of unreadable rows.** Rows encrypted under keys
   destroyed by pre-escrow reinstalls can never be read. The UI must say that
   plainly instead of printing `SecretBoxAuthenticationError` at the user.
4. **Cache-key identity**, copied from `core/media/media_decode.dart`: same key
   AND same decode bounds, and `memCacheHeight` never set anywhere. Two surfaces
   painting one object must produce ONE `ImageCache` entry or every hand-off
   silently starts from scratch. This is the trick that makes chat fast.

### Then, in this order

5. **Vault read path** — smaller surface, no new UX, proves the foundation.
6. **Memory Threads** — needs the foundation plus a notification edge function,
   multi-select upload, dual-consent delete UI, and the timeline redesign.
   **Do the notification first.** Nine proposals produced zero acceptances
   because nothing tells the partner a proposal exists; a beautiful timeline
   nobody knows to open changes nothing.

### Sanity check before starting

Run the audit that would have caught four of this session's bugs — every column
name the repositories write, diffed against `information_schema`. All four were
client code shipped against a schema that was never applied, and none were
catchable by `flutter test`.

### 10a. Traps the vault spec found — do not step in these

Its own critique pass caught twelve defects in the first draft. Four would have
shipped a broken app, so they are recorded here rather than left inside an
813-line document:

- **A named-column SELECT must still include `ciphertext`.** `VaultItem.fromJson`
  starts with `byteaToBytes(json['ciphertext'])`, and `byteaToBytes(null)`
  throws. Drop the column to save bandwidth and every row fails to parse, the
  screen counts them unreadable, and an intact vault renders as EMPTY.
- **Do not put a column list on the realtime publication.** `SupabaseStreamBuilder`
  replaces a cached row wholesale with `payload.newRecord`; without `ciphertext`
  that throws and the row silently disappears. It would break build 14, which is
  on both handsets, with no update channel to fix it.
- **`storage.objects` has a `protect_delete` BEFORE DELETE trigger** that raises
  42501 on any direct delete. A server-side reaper cannot work; the existing
  client-side `storage.remove()` is the mechanism and must not be removed.
- **`deriveSharedKey` is NOT idempotent** despite a comment saying so — it
  recomputes ECDH+HKDF and reassigns on every call, and there are 12 call sites.
  Any cache keyed on a "key epoch" bumped per call thrashes on every navigation.

Two live bugs it surfaced in passing, unrelated to the redesign:

- **Plaintext downgrade is still open.** `deriveSharedKey` returns *normally*
  with `_sharedKey = null` on a malformed partner key, and `encryptBytes` with a
  null key emits zero-nonce/zero-MAC CLEARTEXT. A corrupt partner key silently
  turns encryption off.
- **One vault row (`f9853e45`) has a 16-byte ciphertext** — an empty payload that
  passes the length guard. No read path handles it.
